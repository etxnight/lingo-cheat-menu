## 🛠️ Features

### Buttons/Features

- **Allow Paste**: Removes the anti-paste restriction, allowing you to paste anything into the website.
- **Infinite Time**: Use this when you pause the timer. It removes the pause overlay, allowing you to complete the module while paused.
- **Translation Freeze**: When you get a typing question wrong, it freezes the correct answer instead of fading away. If you enable "Allow Paste," you can copy the correct answer and paste it in.
- **Auto Type**: Automatically types the translation for typing questions. Click the text box, type a space, then delete it to register your input before submitting.
- **Auto Choice**: Highlights the correct answer for a short period on multiple-choice questions.
- **Fake Complete**: If your teacher allows early exit for completed modules, this feature makes your screen appear completed (client-side only). Note: It does not persist after a page reload, but a fix may be in the works.
- **Notepad**: A simple notepad feature to jot down notes that you can copy and paste as needed.
- **Vocab Words**: Displays all vocabulary words and their translations.

## Notes
